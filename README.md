## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- EcmaScript 6
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use Tailwind classes to create responsive layouts without writing a single line of CSS file.

```html
<div
  class="flex flex-col p-4 mx-auto bg-white shadow-lg w-80 h-fit text-center rounded-2xl"
></div>
```

### Continued development

This is the first project in which I use Tailwind, I want to continue improving my knowledge in this framework.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind's documentation is clear and complete, it's a great source of learning.
